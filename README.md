# Modelling Chlamydia and HPV co-infection in patient-derived ectocervix organoids reveals distinct cellular reprogramming

Cervical mucosa is confronted by coinfections with pathogenic microbes, yet their implications in pathogenesis remain unclear. Lack of in-vitro models 
recapitulating cervical epithelium has been a bottleneck to study coinfections. Using patient-derived ectocervical organoids, we systematically modeled 
individual and coinfection dynamics of Human papillomavirus (HPV)16 E6E7 and Chlamydia associated with carcinogenesis. Ectocervical stem cells from 
HPV-negative donors were genetically manipulated to introduce HPV16 E6E7 oncogenes to mimic HPV integration. Organoids from these stem cells developed 
the characteristics of precancerous lesions while retaining the capacity to self-renew and organize into mature stratified epithelium similar to healthy 
organoids. HPV16 E6E7 interfered with Chlamydia development and induced persistence. Unique transcriptional and post-translational responses induced by 
Chlamydia and HPV led to distinct reprogramming of host cell processes. Strikingly, Chlamydia impedes HPV-induced mechanisms that maintain cellular and 
genome integrity, including mismatch repair in the stem cells. Together, our study employing organoids demonstrates the hazard of multiple infections and 
the unique cellular microenvironment they create, potentially contributing to neoplastic progression.
