# Modelling Chlamydia and HPV co-infection in patient-derived ectocervix organoids reveals distinct cellular reprogramming

Coinfections with pathogenic microbes continually confront cervical mucosa, yet theirimplications in pathogenesis remain unclear. Lack of in-vitro modelsrecapitulating cervical epithelium has been a bottleneck to study coinfections.Using patient-derived ectocervical organoids, we systematically modelledindividual and coinfection dynamics of Human papillomavirus (HPV)16 E6E7 andChlamydia, associated with carcinogenesis. The ectocervical stem cells weregenetically manipulated to introduce E6E7 oncogenes to mimic HPV16 integration.Organoids from these stem cells develop the characteristics of precancerouslesions while retaining the self-renew capacity and organize into maturestratified epithelium similar to healthy organoids. HPV16 E6E7 interferes withChlamydia development and induces persistence. Unique transcriptional andpost-translational responses induced by Chlamydia and HPV lead to distinctreprogramming of host cell processes. Strikingly, Chlamydia impedes HPV-inducedmechanisms that maintain cellular and genome integrity, including mismatchrepair in the stem cells. Together, our study employing organoids demonstratethe hazard of multiple infections and the unique cellular microenvironment theycreate, potentially contributing to neoplastic progression.
